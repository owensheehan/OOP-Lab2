OOP Lab 2
Part 1 Generates and outputs two different Bicycle objects.
Part 2 Builds two teams from hardcoded players. Uses the fullname string of each player, splits the name at the space character into an array. The first character from each of the two indexes in the new array are assigned to variables. These two variables are joined using a string builder and the player initials are output using the toString method built in to String.
Part 3 Creates an arraylist of cars by make, model and age. Allows the adding and removing of cars from the list.
